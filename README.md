# AVL_Tree
That is an output of a task assingned for Algorithms and Data Structures Course. It contains an independently implemented AVL Tree.
The project is not entirely finished, it has a rare-appearing bug which can lead to losing some of the tree's data, but all other functualities are working properly. The program is implemented fully in C#.

Here is the task:
Write a program to manage a set of non-negative real numbers (with a maximum of 8 decimal digits before and after the decimal point). The program should allow for quick execution of the following operations:
a) Insertion of a new number into the set
b) Removal of a specified number from the set
c) Search for a given number in the set
d) Find the number of numbers whose integer part is equal to a number specified by the user
e) Display the tree structure along with its elements
f) Execute a command script:

W x - insert x
U x - remove x
S x - find x (response: YES/NO)
L x - count how many numbers have an integer part equal to x
